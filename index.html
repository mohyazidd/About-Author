            <h2>Hi, I'm Mohammad Yazid</h2>
            <h4>Hello guys, Let me introduce myself, my name is Mohammad Yazid, I am now 16 years old, I live in the Riau Islands, precisely in Batam. I was born in Batam, precisely on May 27, 2008. My hobbies are playing video games, playing futsal, soccer, basketball and many more. But my most favorite hobby is martial arts. I am currently pursuing high school education at IDN Boarding School Pamijahan, Bogor to study IT and Religion. Because for me at this time, lessons like this are what we need for the future so that we are not inferior to our own creations, maybe like AI. My own goals are to be a useful person in the future, to make my parents happy so that I can go to heaven with my family in the afterlife and travel around the country, aamiin. I am also a web developer who loves to create pretty and responsive websites. With years of experience in this field, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</h4>
